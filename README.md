# Learning Preference deterministic finite-state automaton from pairwise comparisons

## This project is designed to learn a Preference deterministic finite-state automaton from pairwise comparisons of words.

## Table of Contents
- [aaply](#AALpy is a light-weight automata learning library written in Python. Revised for learning PDFA)
- [Learning](#PreferenceSample.py, RPNIMooreBased.py are the main algorithms. Samplier.py is to generate samples from a given PDFA.)
- [Learning_CaseStudies] (#Two case studies used in the manuscript.)
- [PDFA_JSON](#Saved learned pdfa using .json file)
- [Utility] (#Auxilary functions)
- [Contributing](#contributing)
